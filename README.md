# mathematiCs
Defines a large number of mathematical operations in C from scratch in case I ever need them

## Notes

This is a pretty informal project that will be worked on over time and is not guaranteed to work at any given time. I am building it as I find myself constructing many statistical algorithms (such as time-series features) that require high performance and scalability to large datasets. As such, programming these operations in `C` is a good way to achieve that.
